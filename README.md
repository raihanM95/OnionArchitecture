An Implementation of Onion Architecture with ASP.NET Core 5 Web API. With this Open-Source Template, we create an abstraction layer between the data access and the business logic layer of an application. By using it, we are promoting a more loosely coupled approach to access our data from the database. Also, the code is cleaner and easier to maintain and reuse. Data access logic is in a separate class, or sets of classes called a repository, with the responsibility of persisting the applicationâ€™s business model.
